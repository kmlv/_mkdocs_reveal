<!--Telecommunications technology and automated order placement has caused trading latencies to rapidly decline over the last decade from seconds to milliseconds and microseconds. Market floor specialists have disappeared, and high-frequency trading (HFT) firms now account for a large and increasing fraction of trades worldwide. -->

<ul>
<li><p>Proponents:</p>
<ul>
<li>HFT increases market liquidity and reduces transaction costs. <!--maybe cite: Some academic studies ?--></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Opponents:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The multi-billion-dollar cost of HFT infrastructure is (indirectly) borne by ordinary investors.</p></li>
<li><p>HFT liquidity vanishes when most needed, destabilizing financial markets.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<!--Proponents of HFT claim that HFT has increased market liquidity and reduced transaction costs; and existing academic studies, on balance, tend to support that position. Opponents argue that the multi-billion-dollar cost of HFT infrastructure is indirectly borne by ordinary investors, that HFT liquidity vanishes when most needed, and that HFT could destabilize financial markets.-->

<ul>
<li><p>Existing data are insufficient to resolve the controversy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gathered from a single format -- CDA.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Policy makers and regulators worldwide are already implementing HFT-focused policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiments (lab and field) are a superior alternative to scientifically study and compare market formats in the presence of HFT.</p></li>
</ul>
<!--Our proposed research is motivated by two important facts. First, existing data are insufficient to resolve the controversies regarding the impact of HFT. The data are gathered from markets using only a single format, the continuous double auction (CDA). Therefore, counterfactuals can only be approximated, and alternative market institutions cannot be properly studied. Second, despite the inconclusive evidence, policy makers are already taking actions intended to discourage HFT. In 2014, New York City Attorney General launched a probe of HFT-related practices that resulted in a lawsuit against Barclays. In June 2016, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved a plan put forth by IEX to delay all incoming orders with the intention of reducing the advantage of HFT firms. Regulators around the world have started to make similar moves.-->

<li>Continuous Double Auction (CDA).</li>

<!--In this context, it is of vital importance to scientifically study policy and market alternatives in a controlled environment. We propose to study the impact of HFT using the experimental method to compare existing and alternative market formats, beginning in the laboratory and continuing in the field with a high profile, realistic tournament. We will study the performance of four main market formats in terms of liquidity, stability, and transactions costs. Our study will also help disclose whether the alternative formats raise unanticipated new issues.-->

<!--The baseline market format is the Continuous Double Auction (CDA) which organizes trade in near all major exchanges around the world. Since under CDA trading occurs at any moment and orders are processed with price-time priority, speed technology is crucial.-->

</ol>
<!-- We plan on studying four alternative formats that attempt to keep the virtues of CDA while changing these incentives for speed. We focus in three alternatives: 1) the IEX format which delays incoming orders by 350 microseconds but allows hidden, “pegged” orders; 2) the EBS format which, within a narrow time window, randomizes the sequence in which orders are processed; and 3) the frequent batch auction (FBA) which gives equal priority to all orders received in the same batch of, say, a tenth of a second.-->

<!--Players at any instant choose whether (a) to exit the market and earn a modest flow of income w (= 0 in our implementation), or to participate either as (b) a market maker or (c) a sniper. In the latter two cases players also choose whether to invest in a technology that reduces latency at cost cs per unit of time. 
A market maker chooses a spread  around the fundamental V ; by choosing s she automatically posts a bid at V - 0.5s and an ask at V + 0.5s. In the CDA she makes profit of 0.5s any time she has the smallest spread when an exogenous market order arrives. Her limit orders automatically track V with some fixed latency ; during that latency, the orders are stale in that they do not reflect the current fundamental value. By paying the cost of speed cs the market maker can reduce the latency to (without loss of generality for our purposes) zero.

<!--
 The messaging server still continuously relays time-stamped orders (and cancellations etc.) as usual. However, as illustrated in Figure 2, the FBA matching engine divides the trading day into many submission stages (or batching intervals) of equal length. It collects orders continuously but does not immediately process them. Instead, at the end of a submission stage, all new orders received (with positive latency, these must have been sent before , as indicated by the red tick in Figure 1) are combined with unfilled orders from previous stages. The FBA matching engine then generates a stair-step demand curve from the combined bids and a stair-step supply curve from the combined asks. If demand and supply do not intersect, then there is no trade and all orders carry over to the next batch auction, except those that entered the auction as immediate or cancel. 

If demand and supply do intersect, then the market clears where supply equals demand, i.e., all infra-marginal bids and asks are executed at a uniform price p* that clears the market. (The midpoint is used when there is an interval of market-clearing prices. A rationing rule, independent of time stamp within a batching interval, is used when there is an imbalance of supply and demand at a unique market clearing price.) At time t+delta the FBA matching engine notifies the messaging server of the executed trades and price p* (if demand and supply intersect) and the remaining order book.-->

<!--On August 10, 2016 we conducted a pilot experiment with a Redwood II prototype of CDA and FBA matching engines, using the interfaces shown in Figures 2 and 3. In each format, two groups of four players each completed three five-minute periods. Each period, stochastic realizations using λ_V= 4, λ_B=λ_S=λ_I= 3, F_V  = N(0,0.5), cs=$0.01/sec, τ = 0.5 sec and initial V = 100 were matched across groups and formats; each trading period here roughly translates to a 80 second segment on the NASDAQ OMX exchange for the high-volume SPY contract. In FBA, the batching interval was 5 seconds and the reporting lag was essentially zero.-->
<!--We found a weak uptrend for snipers in CDA, but the share never exceeded 43%; in equilibrium of the BCS model the sniper share is 75%. In FBA the sniper share trended down, as predicted in BCS equilibrium, and fell below 20% in period 3. Almost all other players were makers; Out shares were always miniscule. The share of traders choosing speed trended up in CDA as predicted, reaching almost ⅔ in period 3, and trended down (also consistent with prediction) in FBA, falling to 11% in period 3. -->

<!--The relevant performance metrics here are for transactions cost and informational efficiency; long-run stability issues are less relevant in this simple stylized environment.  Mean spread in FBA period 3 was only 0.22% vs 0.41% in CDA, both in the neighborhood of the predicted 0% and 0.32%, respectively; and overall mean spreads were only about 0.10% higher. FBA was also more informationally efficient: in every period, both CDA markets had higher RMSE than either FBA market; the period 3 averages were about 0.42% in CDA and 0.32% in FBA. -->

<!--These pilot results are encouraging but far from conclusive.

Of course, we must also implement the IEX and EBS variants of the CDA. -->

</ol>
<!--Most importantly, we must go beyond the simple BCS environment with more realistic features as follows. -->
<!--Variable and asymmetric arrival intensities and jump distributions. The Poisson parameter λ_V  can change exogenously during a trading period, and the market buy and sell parameters can take distinct values so that λ_B≠λ_S. The jump distribution can also shift during the trading period. -->
<!--Latent fundamental. In the simplest environment, traders automatically and immediately liquidate their positions at the known fundamental value V. In more realistic environments, V is not observed, and is an implicit function of the unannounced parameters for the compound Poisson processes generating buy and sell limit orders. Traders cannot lock in profit with a single transaction. Instead, they must earn their profits by round trip transactions. Implementation will require several minor changes in the user interface.-->
<!--Discrete price grid. Typical microstructure models allow the bid-ask spread to be determined endogenously. In practice, regulatory authorities set the minimum spread and price grid increment, or tick. By imposing a discrete price grid, we expect to see behavior more like that in contemporary financial markets: order books with positive quantities at several adjacent prices, placed by many different traders. -->
<!--Historical order flow. Instead of experimenter-specified parameters governing exogenous streams of limit orders, those streams will be adapted from historical data from the NYSE or other exchanges. That will allow us to compare the performance of various market formats in times known to be stressful as well as in normal times. -->
<!--Fragmented markets and exchange competition. An asset can be traded in two different exchanges, both using the same format, but possibly with different tick sizes. Information revealing something about the fundamental value might appear primarily or entirely in one of the exchanges, mimicking the environment that has resulted in cross-market latency arbitrage by high-frequency traders.  Alternatively, traders could trade on two different exchanges with equal information but different formats. Traders may (or may not) choose to migrate to the exchange that has endogenously lower trading costs.-->
<!--Automated market makers and investors. Human players will compete against pre-programmed bots acting as investors, market makers and/or snipers. (Earlier features blur the artificial distinction between investors, snipers and makers, and bots will eliminate those distinctions.) Bot-only simulations can be used to establish benchmark predictions in environments intractable to analytic methods. Pitting single humans against programmed equilibrium strategies is a useful diagnostic technique when the basic treatments yield puzzling departures from equilibrium. We will also see how groups of humans fare against bots that react to, e.g., recent measures of risk and return, or that implement ‘momentum ignition” or “front-running” strategies. -->

</ul>
<!--Exploring these differing environments will contribute to fundamental knowledge regarding financial market design. By introducing features one at a time, we will make strong inferences about which environmental aspects shape observed outcomes. By holding constant the realized stochastic process across market formats in any given environment, we can draw causal conclusions regarding comparative performance. For example, we will be able to make clear statements such as “relative to the basic CDA baseline, the IEX format lowers trading cost by 5-8% in normal environment X, but increases value-at-risk by 20-30% in stressful environment Y.” Such statements should help focus conventional econometric analysis of market data, and even by themselves should be helpful for regulators and exchange officials. -->

<!--We have started the lab stage developing simple environments that allow for HFT. Our current progress and preliminary evidence are encouraging on the feasibility of the project and and the quality of the collected evidence. Further evidence from the laboratory and the implementation of tournaments will constitute valuable scientific knowledge on which formats best promote financial market liquidity and stability and, thus, help improve the design of financial markets. Our research infrastructure will be an important contribution for future research on financial market design. -->

## Continuous Double Auction - CDA 

* A _maker_ profits when an investor arrives and executes against her buy/sell order.

* A _sniper_ profits only when $\smash{V(t)}$ jumps and there are stale orders in the book.

* A _Maker_ loses when her stale offers get executed upon a $\smash{V(t)}$ jump (gets sniped) 

* All _fast_ (low latency) players have equal chance of being first to respond to any change in $\smash{V(t)}$. 

<!-- sniping gains/loses are conditional to $\smash{\Delta V(t)}$ exceeding the (smallest) 0.5s set by a market maker. 
If one of the snipers is first, then he makes (and the market maker loses) 0.5s. -->
